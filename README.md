# Voteing-System
Cpts 322 Course Project Repo

This is the course project for WSU CPTS 322 Software Design. 

This is a voting system that enables voters to vote securely from remote sites (rather than centralized polling sites). 
The system is configurable allowing users to specify candidates, total votes available, date range for voting, and the 
winning number of votes reaching which the winning candidate can be determined without waiting until all votes are casted 
(think about the presidential election process).

This will be a C++ QT framework desktop poject that's robust, user-friendly, and deployable. The system should include a 
user interface showing the voting results (e.g., the final votes each candidate received and the winning candidate, and 
possibly the vote statistics by geographic locations or political regions) for which visualizations can be employed to 
enhance the understanding of results.
